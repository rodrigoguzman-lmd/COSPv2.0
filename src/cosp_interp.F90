! History:
! May 2020 - R. Guzman        - Introducing new linear interpolation routine to perform
!                               interpolations for the lidar and radar simulators. Used
!                               along the full vertical extent when regridding low
!                               vertical variability fields, and mixing it with the legacy
!                               vertical regridding routine COSP_CHANGE_VERTICAL_GRID in
!                               order to avoid striping features to appear in mid-high
!                               atmopsheric levels of high variability fields (ATB,
!                               Reflectivities).
